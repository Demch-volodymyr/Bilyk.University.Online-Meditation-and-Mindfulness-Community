        <h2>Simple Meditation Method</h2>
        <p>To begin your meditation practice, find a comfortable and quiet place to sit or lie down. Close your eyes and focus on your breath. Take deep, slow breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. Notice the sensation of the breath as it enters and leaves your body. Whenever your mind starts to wander, gently bring your focus back to your breath. Continue this practice for a few minutes, gradually increasing the duration as you become more comfortable.</p>
